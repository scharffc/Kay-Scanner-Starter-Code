# Kay-Scanner-Starter-Code
**Starter Code for the Kay Scanner Assignment**

Students learn how to implement the scanner of an experimental language. This is the first phase of the compilation process.

Implement your own `TokenStream.java in the main/java/com/scanner/project folder that follows the lexical grammar for Kay.

That is the only file that you will be changing in this assignment. Make sure your code passes all the tests.

Make sure to keep `package com.scanner.project` at the top of the files or ekse it will not work.
